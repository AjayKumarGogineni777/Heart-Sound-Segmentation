# Heart-Sound-Segmentation
Heart Sound (PCG signal) segmentation into its fundamental classes: S1, Systole, S2, Diastole using U-Net and LSTM. 
These architectures are well studied, 
this post will help you to understand the code clearly so that you can experiment on various versions of the data and architectures later.
